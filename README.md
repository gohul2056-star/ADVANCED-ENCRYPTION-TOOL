# üîê Secure AES-256 Encryption Tool

The Secure AES-256 Encryption Tool is a lightweight, browser-based application designed to encrypt and decrypt files using the AES-256 standard. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool ensures strong client-side security without requiring any server interaction. Whether you're a developer, cybersecurity learner, or privacy-conscious user, this tool offers a simple yet powerful way to protect your files‚Äîright from your browser.

## üåü Why This Tool?

In an age where data breaches and surveillance are increasingly common, local encryption is more important than ever. This tool empowers users to take control of their file security by performing all operations within the browser. No files are uploaded, stored, or transmitted externally‚Äîmaking it ideal for sensitive documents, personal backups, or educational demonstrations.

## üß∞ Features

- **AES-256 Encryption**: Utilizes the Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key for robust protection.
- **Client-Side Processing**: All encryption and decryption happens locally‚Äîyour data never leaves your device.
- **Dual Functionality**: Switch seamlessly between **Encrypt** and **Decrypt** modes.
- **Password-Based Security**: Files are encrypted using a user-defined password, with key derivation handled securely.
- **HMAC Verification**: Ensures file integrity and authenticity during decryption.
- **Responsive UI**: Clean, intuitive interface optimized for both desktop and mobile browsers.

## üîê How It Works

1. Choose a file to encrypt or decrypt.
2. Enter a secure password.
3. Click the appropriate action button.
4. Download the processed file instantly.

The tool uses the Web Crypto API to generate keys, perform AES-CBC encryption, and apply HMAC for verification. All cryptographic operations are handled securely and efficiently in-browser.

## üìö Security Highlights

- **AES-256**: Trusted by governments and enterprises for high-grade encryption.
- **Browser-Based**: Eliminates server vulnerabilities and data exposure.
- **File Privacy**: Strengthened through password-derived keys and local processing.
- **HMAC**: Adds an extra layer of integrity checking to prevent tampering.

## üë• Who Is It For?

- Developers needing quick, secure file encryption without installing software.
- Cybersecurity students exploring client-side cryptography.
- Privacy advocates who prefer local tools over cloud-based solutions.
- Educators demonstrating encryption concepts in a visual, hands-on way.
